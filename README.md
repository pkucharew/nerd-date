This was a fictional landing page that I created as a part of an interview process. We were provided with brand colours and a logo. The rest was up to my imagination. I've coded the page with basic HTML & CSS. I decided to use playful elements taken from nerd or geek culture such as the pixel video game icons & comic book background textures.
